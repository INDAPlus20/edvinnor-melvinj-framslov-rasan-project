## Welcome to d'Osqeratet
Introducing a multiplayer strategic board game where you struggle to be the first among many to earn 300 hp and graduate Kongliga tekniska hogskolan. In order to achieve this you will have to pass a total of 20 exams over 5 years. This will take stamina, the help of friends, money and dedication. But most of all it will take cunning. At the end of each year there will be torturous random events such as prosam or the dreaded group project where your ingenuity and will to live will be tested. Here you will have the opportunity to betray your friends, make connections, destroy each other's schedules and conquer the system.

Will you have the strength to complete this near impossible mission littered with random prosam essays and unreliable classmates, will you be the player with enough vigour, discipline, work ethic and lack of need for human interaction to be the first to graduate. 

There is only one way to find out, enter the campus!
